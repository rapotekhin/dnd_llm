    "The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.",
    "The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast can make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it."
